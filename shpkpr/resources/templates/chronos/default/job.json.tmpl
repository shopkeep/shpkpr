    Built-In Job Template

    This file contains the default template used by shpkpr when adding a new
    Chronos job if no custom template is provided.

    With sensible defaults for most options, it should be possible to deploy a
    new or updated application with very minimal configuration.

    This template makes some assumptions about your job:

    - It is configured via environment variables (12-factor style).
    - It runs in a Docker container.

    4 values are required to run a job using this template:

    - CHRONOS_NAME: The name of the Chronos job
    - CHRONOS_OWNER: The email address of the team responsible for the job
    - CHRONOS_CMD: The command that will be executed by Chronos
    - DOCKER_REPOTAG: The repotag of the Docker image to be used

    {#
        The scheduling for the job, in ISO8601 format. Consists of 3 parts
        separated by `/`:

        - The number of times to repeat the job: `Rn` to repeat `n` times, or
          `R` to repeat forever
        - The start time of the job. An empty start time means start
          immediately. Our format is ISO8601: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD` (e.g.,
          `1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00`) where:
            - `YYYY` = four-digit year
            - `MM`   = two-digit month (01 = January, etc.)
            - `DD`   = two-digit day of month (01 through 31)
            - `hh`   = two-digit hour in 24-hour time (00 through 23)
            - `mm`   = two-digit minute (00 through 59)
            - `ss`   = two-digit second (00 through 59)
            - `s`    = one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a
                       second
            - `TZD`  = time zone designator (`Z` for UTC or `+hh:mm` or `-hh:mm`
                       for UTC offset)
        - The run interval, defined following the "Duration" component of the
          ISO8601 standard. `P` is required. `T` is for distinguishing M(inute)
          and M(onth)––it is required when specifying Hour/Minute/Second. For
          example:
            - `P10M`           = 10 months
            - `PT10M`          = 10 minutes
            - `P1Y12M12D`      = 1 year, 12 months, and 12 days
            - `P12DT12M`       = 12 days and 12 minutes
            - `P1Y2M3DT4H5M6S` = 1 year, 2 months, 3 days, 4 hours, and 5
                                 minutes
